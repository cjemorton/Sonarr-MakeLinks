.SH "NAME"
Sonarr::MakeLinks \- Make hard links using Sonarr api for tv shows. (Continuing, Ended, Incomplete)
.SH "VERSION"
.IX Header "VERSION"
Version 0.01
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
This module uses the Sonarr api to create hard links of all shows in its database.
.PP
It sorts these shows into three categories.
.PP
Continuing \- These are shows that are currently airing.
Ended \- Shows that are no longer producing new episodes. \- All episodes are available on disk.
Incomplete \- Shows that are no longer producing new episodes. \- The local disk is missing episodes.
.PP
Media servers such as Plex then are able to point a library at each of the folders.
.PP
This has several benifits and effects.
\&\- Hard links take up little to no additional file space.
\&\- All media for sonarr can be kept in a single \s-1ARCHIVE\s0 directory.
\&\- Browsing the Continuing library on plex shows currently running shows.
\&\- Browsing the Ended library on plex shows old shows that are complete and archived on disk. 
\&\*(-- (Binge watching with no missing episodes from the series.)
\&\- Browsing the Incomplete library on plex easilly identifies shows that are old and ended, yet not all episodes are available.
\&\*(-- (Binge watching incomplete means there may be missing episodes as reported by sonarr.)
.PP
\&\-\- \s-1NOTE: TARGET_DIR\s0 must be on the same filesystem as media collection. This is due to the nature of hardlinks.
\&\*(-- \s-1NOTE:\s0 To read more about hard links please type 'man ln' at a shell.
\&\*(-- \s-1NOTE:\s0 This script assumes that \s-1ALL\s0 media being tracked by sonarr is in a single folder on a single filesystem.
