Sonarr-MakeLinks

Sonarr::MakeLinks is used to automate the creation of hard linked directories using data from Sonarr for use in Plex Media Player.

The Senario is this:

- Collection of Television shows tracked by Sonarr.
- All shows are on one filesystem. (Script doesn't support multiple filesystems yet.)
- When Sonarr::MakeLinks is run it querys Sonarr through an api call and does the following things.
-- Retrieves a list of every show in the Sonarr database.
-- Checks the status of the show. ex. Continuing or Ended.
-- Checks to see if all episodes of the show are available.
-- Based on the above information it sorts the shows into three categories. Continuing, Ended, Incomplete.

- Continuing - These are shows that are currently on air.
- Ended - These shows are ended, and all episodes are available on disk.
- Incomplete - These shows are ended, the local disk is missing episodes.

- There are several bits of information this module needs to be provided with.

SONARR_API_KEY: Can be found in the web interface of sonarr.
IP: The ip address of the server running sonarr.
PORT: The port number of sonarr.
DIR: This is the directory that all the hard links will be created in.
- You will have to create the sub folders in this directory.
- The folders need to be called: continuing ended incomplete

-- The direcotry stucture should look like this.

-- plex-links
	continuing
	ended
	incomplete

-- NOTE: Due to the nature of hard links, this folder needs to be on the same filesystem as the origional media.

There are several reasons why this script is useful.
1. When browsing Plex shows are kept in neat categories, old shows that are off air are easilly found in Ended yet they are kept out of the way of new.
2. Because of the hard links, if media files are deleted in Plex only the hard links are deleted. Not the archived files. 
-- This can be useful in a number of situations. 
-- -- For example, if anyone decides they dislike a show in plex and clicks delete...
-- -- Depending on CRON settings, the show will automatically pop back up in plex again.

The operating system this module is developed and used on is FreeBSD, anything else is untested.


EXAMPLE:

#!/usr/bin/env perl
use Sonarr::MakeLinks
Sonarr::MakeLinks::run_api_call("SONARR_API_KEY", "127.0.0.1", "8989", "/tv/plex-links");

ONE LINER EXAMPLE:
perl -MSonarr::MakeLinks -e "Sonarr::MakeLinks::run_api_call('API_KEY', '127.0.0.1', '8989', '/tv/plex-links');"
